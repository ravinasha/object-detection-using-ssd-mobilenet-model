## Overview
The SSD MobileNet model is an efficient solution for object detection tasks, combining the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) framework with the lightweight MobileNet backbone for real-time object recognition.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that the following software and libraries are installed:
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Other required Python packages (detailed in the installation section)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravinasha/object-detection-using-ssd-mobilenet-model.git
   cd object-detection-using-ssd-mobilenet-model
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd object_detection
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your test images in the `object_detection/test_images` directory.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform object detection on these images.
3. The output will display images with detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes.
